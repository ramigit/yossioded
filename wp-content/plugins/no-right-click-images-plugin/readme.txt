Disables right click context menu on images to help deter leeches from glomming images.

== Description ==
The No Right Click Images Plugin Plugin uses JavaScript to change the right click action on IMG tags to disable context menu. It disables the context menu on images only so other right click actions, such as links, should work normally.

Since it uses JavaScript, it targets more images than using a plugin that filter pages and rewrite the tag. The plugin will find many images generated in scripts or pasted into posts and comments, that similar plugins will not find.

It is impossible to keep people from stealing images that appear in web pages, but this plugin will deter casual theft from surfers who do not want to interpret HTML or dig into the browser cache.
 
== Installation ==
1. Download the plugin.
2. Upload the plugin to your wp-content/plugins directory.
3. Activate the plugin.

== Changelog ==
